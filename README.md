# Hospitality_Domain_Analysis
AtliQ Grands a prominent player in the hospitality industry for almost two decades wanted to know why are they loosing market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category .
üìçIn My Project , I have accomplished the following tasks-
- Conducted ETL Operations to extract, transform and load data.
- Cleaned and transformed data using Power Query editor.
-Built a data model by establishing relationships between the fact table and dimension table to facilitate analysis.
- Created DAX Measures to calculate and analyze data effectively.
-Data Visualization.

KPIs of Project-
ADR , RevPar , Occupancy Rate, DBRN,DSRN,DURN.
-ADR(average daily rate) means the average revenue that a hotel receives for each occupied guest rooms.
-RevPAR (revenue per available room) RevPar helps hotels measure their revenue-generating performance to accurately price rooms. RevPar can help hotels to compare themselves against other properties or brands.
-Occupancy Rate means total successful bookings happened to the total rooms available.
